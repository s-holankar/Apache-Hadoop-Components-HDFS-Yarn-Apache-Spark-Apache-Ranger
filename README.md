Apache Hadoop is a powerful framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers. It consists of several core components and tools that enable big data processing.

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): A distributed file system designed to store large files across multiple machines. It provides high throughput access to application data and is fault-tolerant.

MapReduce: A programming model for processing large data sets in parallel across a Hadoop cluster. It consists of two main functions: Map (processing input data) and Reduce (aggregating the results).

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): A resource management layer that allows multiple data processing engines (like MapReduce, Spark, etc.) to run on a single cluster. It manages and allocates resources dynamically.

Apache Hive: A data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop that provides a SQL-like query language (HiveQL) for querying and managing large datasets in HDFS.

Apache Pig: A high-level platform for creating programs that run on Hadoop. Pig uses a scripting language called Pig Latin, which simplifies the process of writing MapReduce programs.

Apache HBase: A NoSQL database that runs on top of HDFS. It provides real-time read/write access to large datasets and is designed for sparse data storage.

Apache Spark: A fast, in-memory data processing engine that can run on top of Hadoop. It supports batch processing, stream processing, machine learning, and graph processing.

Apache Flume: A distributed service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data from various sources to HDFS.

Apache Sqoop: A tool for transferring bulk data between Hadoop and structured data stores such as relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Apache Oozie: A workflow scheduler system that manages Hadoop jobs. It allows users to define complex data processing workflows that can include multiple jobs and dependencies.

Apache Zookeeper: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and group services. It is often used in distributed applications.

Apache Knox: A gateway for interacting with the Hadoop ecosystem, providing a single access point for REST APIs, web applications, and other services.

Apache Ranger: A framework for managing and enforcing security across the Hadoop ecosystem. It provides centralized security administration and fine-grained access control.


Use Cases :

1. Data Processing and Analytics: Using tools like Hive and Spark to analyze large datasets.
2. Data Ingestion: Collecting data from various sources using Flume and Sqoop.
3. Real-Time Processing: Leveraging HBase and Spark Streaming for real-time data analytics.
4. Batch Processing: Running batch jobs using MapReduce or Pig for large-scale data processing.
5. Workflow Management: Scheduling and managing complex workflows using Oozie.
